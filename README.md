# Coreander

A personal Ebooks server, Coreander indexes the ebooks (only in Epub format at the moment) that it finds in the passed folder, and provides a web interface to search and access them.

**Warning**
This code has been quickly hacked away during holidays and lacks proper testing. Although I've using it extensively without problems, you may find issues, so use it at your own risk.

## Features

* Fast search engine powered by Bleve, with support for ebooks in multiple languages.
* High-performance web server powered by Fiber.
* Lightweight, responsive high-contrast web interface based on Bootstrap, specially designed for mobile and e-ink devices.
